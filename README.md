# dotVoting
We do a lot of dot-voting. It works well in person, but is hard to do virtually. Maybe a simple app where you could set up a basic dot-vote poll and run it.  Another pitfall of dot-voting: People are biased by others' votes ("everybody voted for that, so I will too"). This app might be able to keep anonymity. 

This is just a quick dot voting app to take care of the basics !
